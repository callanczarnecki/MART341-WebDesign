                Step 1: Location
            </h2>

            <p>
                Alright for this there is a lot to consider.
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty</li>
                        <p>
                            Its important to make sure you choose the right grade for your climb. V0/5.6 is the starting grade for most outdoor climbing and anybody can do these grades.
                        </p>
                    <li>Location</li>
                        <p>
                            While there are plenty of good climbs around the world, make sure you 
                            choose something close enough to you to climb. Or be prepared to make the trip. 
                            Utah crack clibms are awesome, but we up in Montana need to drive 6 hours to get to them.
                        </p>
                    <li>Type</li>
                        <p>
                            Make sure you're climbing the right type of climb for what you want. If you want 
                            to climb trad, make sure you find a trad climb and not a sport climb. If you walk up to 
                            a sport climb with trad gear you're gonna be really sad.
                        </p>

                Finding the Climb
            </h2>

            <p>
                This is surprisingly hard a lot of the time. There are a few very important things to remember with this.
                <ul>
                    <li>Use GPS if its available</li>
                    <li>Look for Landmarks in the Pictures</li>
                    <li>And Lastly, if you get lost and can't find the climb, just have <b style="color:rgb(109, 245, 18)">FUN</b></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>
                Lastly Climbing!
            </h2>

            <p>
                Now for the Fun Part! <br>
                This really depends on what style of climbing you're going for. But overall there is a few global pointers for this!
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Gear and Be Safe. Don't skip bolts or pieces of protection, unless you're soloing. Wear a helmet <b>ALWAYS.</b> And Use a 
                    Crashpad when bouldering.</li>
                    <li>Make Sure You Have a Way Down. If you're climbing a piece of rock, make sure that the rope is twice the height of the rock or 
                    you'll get stuck or if you're bouldering there is a route down.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Lastly! Go Ballistic and Use Power Noises!</p>
