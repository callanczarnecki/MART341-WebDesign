What is an advantage to using a text editor? 
It allows us to actually edit our files. But often times its
really nice to have a more complex text editor than something
like notepad. I'm using VSCode because I'm familiar with it and
it also has a lot of nice features like the preview window, autocomplete,
file management, cool colors, etc. 

Is there an advantage of using a relative vs an absolute URL?
Relative URLs are nice because they are easy to type and the
linked files must be in the same file system. They also will
never change or go down without the creators knowing.

Absolute URLs allow us to link anything on the internet, but they
can be hefty to type and go down without us knowing. If we link a 
youtube video it can be taken down at any time and our website breaks.
